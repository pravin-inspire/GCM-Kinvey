# Push-PhoneGap
> Test Drive Push Notifications on Kinvey with this sample PhoneGap application.

## Installation

1. Make sure the [PhoneGap CLI](https://github.com/mwbrooks/phonegap-cli) is installed.
2. Replace `App Key` and `App Secret` (`www/js/index.js`) with your application credentials.
3. For Android, replace `Project ID` (`www/js/push.js`) with your Google Project ID.
4. Build the project: `phonegap build <android|ios>`.

## Testing
To send a Push Notification, make sure you [configured Push](http://devcenter.kinvey.com/phonegap/guides/push#ConsoleSetUp). Then, click **Send a Push** in the navigation, and send a message. Depending on whether you clicked the **Register for Push** button in your app you will receive the Push Notification.

## Gotchas
Push Notifications are intended for real devices. Push will fail on the iOS Simulator. For Android, notifications can be made to work on the emulator as follows:

1. Open the **Android SDK Manager**, and install the **Google Cloud Messaging for Android Library** under the **Extras** section.
2. Open the **AVD Manager** and create a new Google API Emulator.
3. After launching the emulator, go to **Menu → Settings → Accounts & Sync**. Add a **Google account**.
4. Deploy your PhoneGap project to the emulator to test Push Notifications.
